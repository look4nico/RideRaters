            Like most app operators, RideRaters collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
            browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
            and the date and time of each visitor request. RideRaters’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
            information is to better understand how RideRaters’s visitors use its app. From time to time, RideRaters may
            release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the
            usage of its app.
        </p>
        <p class="proxima-regular privacy-para">
            RideRaters also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
            for logged
            in users and for users of the RideRaters API. RideRaters only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the
            same
            circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

            Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
        </p>
        <p class="proxima-regular privacy-para">
            Certain visitors to RideRaters’s apps choose to interact with RideRaters in ways that require RideRaters to
            gather
            personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that RideRaters gathers depends on the
            nature of
            the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a RideRaters account to provide a username and
            email
            address.In each case, RideRaters collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to
            fulfill the
            purpose of the visitor’s interaction with RideRaters. RideRaters does not disclose personally-identifying
            information
            other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with
            the
            caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain app-related activities.

            information
            publicly or provide it to others. However, RideRaters does not disclose personally-identifying information other
            than as
            described below.

            Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
        </p>
        <p class="proxima-regular privacy-para">
            RideRaters discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of
            its
            employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process
            it on
            RideRaters's behalf or to provide services available at RideRaters's apps, and (ii) that have agreed not to
            disclose it
            to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home
            country; by using RideRaters's apps, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. RideRaters will

            personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or
            other
            governmental request, or when RideRaters believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to

            features,
            solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with RideRaters and our products.If you
            send us
            a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to
            publish it in
            order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. RideRaters takes all
            measures
            reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially

            Cookies
        </p>
        <p class="proxima-regular privacy-para">
            A cookie is a string of information that an app stores on a visitor's device, and that the visitor's browser
            provides to
            the app each time the visitor returns. RideRaters uses cookies to help RideRaters identify and track visitors,
            their
            usage of RideRaters app, and their app access preferences. RideRaters visitors who do not wish to have cookies
            placed on
            their devices should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using RideRaters's apps, with the drawback that
            certain
            features of RideRaters's apps may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

            Business Transfers
        </p>
        <p class="proxima-regular privacy-para">
            If RideRaters, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that RideRaters goes
            out of
            business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a
            third
            party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of RideRaters may continue to use
            your

            information
            about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver
            targeted
